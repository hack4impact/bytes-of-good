> The bare-bones, [Pug-driven](https://pugjs.org) landing page for the incredible Bytes of Good org ✨

🚀 [**Visit the live site**](impactpodcast.hack4impact.org)

## Tech stack

This project uses [**Eleventy**](https://11ty.dev) for development and production builds. If you've ever used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (maybe for building sites on GitHub pages), this is super similar! The only _real_ difference is using JavaScript packages for all our plugins instead of Ruby. This makes setup a lot simpler across devices from our experience.

For the pages themselves, we use a combination of [Pug / Jade templates](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and [Scss](https://sass-lang.com) for our styles. No, we don't use bootstrap or any other CSS library! We write our CSS with our bare hands 💪

## Project structure

```
src/ -> all our assets, pug templates, scripts, and styles
| 🗄 _assets -> images, fonts, etc copied directly to build/
| 📶 _data -> global data pulled in from the Contentful CMS
| 📦 _includes -> pug templates and SVG assets imported into pages
| 💅 _sass -> sass files loaded into your HTML templates
  | _imports -> sass files that are imported, *not* copied directly to build/
| 🚏 [route files] -> templates outside _includes = *routes* on our site
build/ -> generated from src/ when running build commands
```

### Some important frontmatter properties

If you open a page like `src/index.pug` you'll notice some variables assigned between some `---`s. These are called [frontmatter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) properties:

- `title` - the page title displayed in your browser's tab.
- `layout` - the name of the Pug template file to use as a "wrapper" around the page. For example, `layout: layout` points to the `_includes/layout.pug` file.
- `styles` - any page-specific styles to load from the `_sass` directory. For example, `styles: home` points to the `_sass/home.scss` file.

## Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first. Then, run this terminal command inside the project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

## Spin up the dev server

```sh
npm start
```

This will spin up a local development server (using [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io)) with live reloading on file changes.

## Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

This should create a `build/` directory that we'll serve using the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) deploy service. Just **don't edit any of these files directly!** These files are generated from `src/`, so make all your edits in there.
