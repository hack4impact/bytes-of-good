## Tech stack

This project uses [**Eleventy**](https://11ty.dev) for development and production builds. If you've ever used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (maybe for building sites on GitHub pages), this is super similar! The only _real_ difference is using JavaScript packages for all our plugins instead of Ruby. This makes setup a lot simpler across devices from our experience.

For the pages themselves, we use a combination of [Pug / Jade templates](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and [Scss](https://sass-lang.com) for our styles. No, we don't use bootstrap or any other CSS library! We write our CSS with our bare hands üí™

## Project structure

```
src/ -> all our assets, templates, scripts, and styles
| üóÑ _assets -> images, fonts, etc copied directly to build/
| üì∂ _data -> global data pulled in from the Contentful CMS
| üì¶ _includes -> templates and SVG assets imported into pages
| üíÖ _sass -> global styles, with styles.scss as the main source of truth
| üöè [route files] -> templates outside _includes = *routes* on our site
build/ -> generated from src/ when running build commands
```

## Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first. Then, run this terminal command inside the project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

## Spin up the dev server

```sh
npm start
```

This will spin up a local development server (using [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io)) with live reloading on file changes.

## Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

This should create a `build/` directory that we'll serve using the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) deploy service. Just **don't edit any of these files directly!** These files are generated from `src/`, so make all your edits in there.
